For the research multiple queries were used, some of the unique representations are as follows:
	•	Entities are ammonised as Sector[space]Entity[space]Sub-Entity. The split is used to reduce this to the Sector only
	•	The Eventclass 'Suspicious and persistant' is excluded because it reflects our ‘Repeat Offender’ SIEM alarm, which was excluded for this study.
	•	The Eventclass 'Suspicious and persistant' is excluded wherever necessary because it reflects our ‘Repeat Offender’ SIEM alarm, which was excluded for this study.
	•	The various time windows used in the queries are to specify the research time window.

10) Prediction window distribution – Sensor Network: This query allows us to understand the life expectancy of a prediction but showing the number of prediction made for each prediction window, from 0 to 90 days.

	select all_predictions.window, count (distinct predictions) from (
